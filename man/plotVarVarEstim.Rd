\usage{
plotVarVarEstim(v, sdEta, sdNu, phi, nbK = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{the estimated variances of the diff k operator}

\item{sdEta}{standard deviation in Random Walk}

\item{sdNu}{standard deviation in AR(1)}

\item{phi}{the autocorrelative AR(1) parameter}

\item{nbK}{number of diff k elements to consider}
}
\description{
plot the estimated variances v_k against the true variances for the diff k operator (y_{t+k} - y_t) for k = 1 to nbK
}
